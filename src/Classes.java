//  In Java, there isn't a specific concept referred to as "Standard Classes."
//  However, Java has a comprehensive standard library known as the Java Standard Library or
//  Java Standard API.

//  This library includes a wide range of classes and packages that provide
//  essential functionality for Java programmers.
